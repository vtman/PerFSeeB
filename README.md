<h1>Periodic full sensitivity spaced seeds</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
We consider sequences of symbols <tt>A</tt>, <tt>C</tt>, <tt>G</tt> and <tt>T</tt>. Suppose there is a long reference sequence (for a human genome it may have length of 3.2 billion symbols). There is also a set of short sequences (called <i>reads</i>), their size is around 50-300 symbols. We know that the reads are chunks of another long sequence which is in some way is close to the reference sequence. Our goal is to align those reads with respect to the reference sequence.
